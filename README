Hooks for lbfgsb for J.
Pretty much works the same as lbfgs (which I shamelessly copied the J code for), except the return
values are different, and it requires a different sized workspace. lbfgsb allows for box constraints,
and so it is very much more useful than the unconstrained lbfgs optimization.

Maybe I'll eventually write some convenience wrappers for this, if I have a need for them.


I've included the original driver examples in fortran, in case folks want to try different kinds 
of searches or particularly like Fortran.
